The robot is an obstacle avoidance type, it allows you to travel the track avoiding all the obstacles on the circuit, the robot consists of 3 sensors that allow it to detect the obstacles in its environment and through them make the decision whether to turn to the left or turn to the right. right.
Robot electronic components:
- Ultrasonic sensor x3
- Servomotor 180 x1
- DC motor 400 rpm 6v x1
- Arduino UNO x 1
- 18650 holder x4
- powerbank 5v x1

The design of the robot was carried out on the Tinkercad platform based on an already created project, the parts had to be resized and printed on a 3D printer.
In order to upload the code to the robot, the ARDUINO IDE platform was used, which links directly to the Atmega microcontroller.
